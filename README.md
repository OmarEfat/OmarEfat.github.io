# Getting started

### 1. Formatting a resume using Markdown

An awesome tip to consider while writing a resume from _**Modern Technical Writing, by Andrew Etter**_ 
1. **Consistency**: Always make all sections of your resume consistent with the same formatting
2. **Don't duplicate**: Break your resume into sections and don't duplicate

### 2. Install Jekyll
**Prerequisites:**
1. Check if you have Ruby version 2.5.0 or higher
  - You can check using ```ruby-v ``` in your command line

  ![Check Ruby version](check-ruby-version.gif)
  If you don't have it or it's not higher than 2.5.0, you can download it from here [Ruby version 2.5.0 or higher](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)

2. [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download)
   - You can check using ```gcc -v ``` ,  ```g++ -v ``` in your command line ( if any is missing, you can download them from [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/)).


Now to install Jekyll, you need to write on the command line ```gem install jekyll bundler ```

### 3. Creating new Jekyll site
Now after installing Jekyll, we can start building a Jekyll site

 1. To create a new site, you will need to write this command ```jekyll new ``` follow by ```your project name ```

  ![New website](building-site.gif)

  2. Now you need to go to the new directory, so you will need the command ```cd ``` followed by ```your project name ```
  3. Now to compile the site that's already automatically generated by Jekyll, you will need this command  ```bundle exec jekyll serve ```
  
  4. You will get a link for the localhost port that your generated website is uploaded on, you will copy/paste this link to your browser

# Building website

Now you have set up everything! It's time to build your website.

1. Choosing your website theme 
   - Visit [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org/).
   - Write on the search jekyll-theme-"then here write your theme"
   ![jekyll theme](jekyll-theme.gif)
   

2. Open the Jekyll folder that we have created already ``` On your Visual Studio Code: File > Open Folder > Select the folder  ``` 

**You can then customize the design and the layout of your generated website, but for our example, I will use a built-in theme**

3. We can now clone the repository theme that we have found on step 1. Keep on mind that few themes can be deployed as GitHub pages, [click here](https://pages.github.com/themes/) to know more about supported themes.
   - Clone the theme repository
      - Copy the repository link from GitHub
      - Go to Visual Studio, select Clone from Git
      - Select the folder in your local device to save the cloned repository
   - Install the packages for the theme
      - Open the terminal through Terminal > New Terminal
      -  Write the following command  ```bundle install```
   - Compile the website
     - On the same terminal, write the following command ```bundle exec jekyll serve```
   - Your themed website will be hosted on the local server, copy the link and paste it in your browser.


Here is more illustration for the process mentioned above:

# Hosting your resume

Now after having the site and theme ready, you will need just need to change the content of the index.md to the resume.md that you have built already.

1. Go to ```index.md``` or ```index.markdown``` 
2. Delete the content thereafter ```layout:default```
3. Paste the content of ```resume.md```
   ![resume](resume.gif)
4. To delete the header, go to ```default.html``` and remove the content inside the tag ``` <header>``` 
5. Add this line to your "Gemfile" 
```gem "GitHub-pages", "~> GITHUB-PAGES-VERSION", group: :jekyll_plugins```



# Uploading and hosting  on GitHub
